Geopandas combines the capabilities of the data analysis library [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) with other packages like [**shapely**](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) and [**fiona**](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html) for managing spatial data.\n",

    "Typically reading the data into Python is the first step of the analysis pipeline. In GIS, there exists various dataformats such as [Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [KML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language), and [GPKG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPackage) that are probably the most common vector data formats. **Geopandas** is capable of reading data from all of these formats (plus many more).
