# Geolab - Intro to Python for spatial data

This repo is a trilogy of notebooks I prepare for the workshop **Introduction to Python language and Google Colab for spatial data visualization and analysis**, a Professional Geospatial Workshop organised by the Geospatial Lab of Hong Kong (see the [poster](https://csdigeolab.gov.hk/en/upcoming-events/professional-geospatial-talk-1015-1022) of the workshop for details).

This workshop aims to let attendances without prior knowledge in coding grasp a taste of Python. Therefore, not much theoretical knowledges are covered. The rundown workshop is organised in a way for attendances to **make maps immediately**. In that way, their motivation could stay high (they could see the product, easily) when need to learn less-fun aspects of spatial data afterwards.

The notebooks (tentatively) covers the following:

- A (very) quick intro to Python
- Using Google Colab for Jupyter Notebooks
- Create static maps with **matplotlib** and **contextily**
- Create interactive, dynamic maps with **folium**

## About the notebooks

The notebooks are written in Markdown, then converted to Jupyter Notebook using the **[jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext)** plugin of Jupyter with the following command.

```
jupytext --to notebook THEMDNOTEBOOK.md
```
