    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This session will cover the basics of Python, and introduce elements that will help you get familiar with Python as an interactive computational environment for exploring data. The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser, called a Jupyter Notebook.  It allows presentation of text and graphics to be combined with Python code that can be run interactively, with the results appearing inline.  We are looking at a Jupyter notebook now.  Note that Jupyter is a relatively recent name for this so sometimes you may still see it referred to as an IPython noteboook.  Jupyter is just the new version of IPython notebooks, but now also supports a variety of other languages and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on this entry in the directory within the Jupyter Notebook, another tab will be created in your browser, containing this notebook, ready to use.  Go ahead and do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it has cells, that contain text (until farther down in the notebook). These are markdown cells. Notice the pulldown list for the cell type contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code -- which we will use for Python code mainly, though it could use other languages\n",
    "- Markdown, like this cell, using a flavor of structured text like that used in Wikipedia and many other platforms\n",
    "- Other options will appear depending on what else is installed for use with Jupyter, like kernels for Scala, R, Octave, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the contents of a cell by double-clicking on it.  Try it on this cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready to save it or exit edit mode, just use `Shift + Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how the code cells work next, in the context of learning a bit about the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going on to that, though, just note that you can use Markdown syntax to format your text.  Documentation on the markdown syntax is available here: http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can also contain programs, or code.  We will be using Python code extensively in this course.  The next cell contains a Python command, and that command can be executed in the Notebook by clicking Shift-Enter on the cell, or selecting Cell/Run Cells from the menu, or clicking on the Run icon  (left of the black square), on the toolbar.  Notice that it executes the command and writes the output below the cell.\n",

    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language, also referred to as a high-level language, or as a scripting language.  What this means is that when you write some commands, or statements that are meaningful in the Python language, the Python 'interpreter' reads the command, figures out what the intended computation is, and then executes it.  This differs from low-level languages like C or C++, in which you generally have to compile code  before you can run it, and if you find errors they have to be diagnosed and then the code re-compiled before you can run it.  Interpreted languages skip the compile step, and just execute code directly, and if there are errors, they are seen at run-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Interpreter Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write and execute Python code, we generally do that within an environment known as an Interpreter. Python interpreter and editing environments can be quite varied. Some options include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting Python at the command line, by typing 'python' at the command prompt (c:\\ on windows, for example)\n",
    "1. Starting an editor that can edit and run Python, like Idle, which comes built-in with Python,or programming editors like Scite.\n",
    "1. The way we will generally interact with Python is through Juoyter Notebooks like this one, that provide a Python environment that runs in your web browser.  This is the environment you are looking at now, with a mixture of headings, text, and code embedded in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hello World!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first programming command demonstrated when you are learning a programming language is usually to make the computer print 'Hello World!'.  In Python, doing this is pretty simple:"

The convention of using **.py** as the suffix for a Python script makes it easy to find and run such scripts and to have the Python interpreter parse the statements and execute them one at a time, from top to bottom, as though they had been entered interactively (there are some minor differences in how the interpreter parses interactive commands as compared to scripts, but we will ignore that for now).\n",
